As an avid movie watcher, I love diving into everything anything about a movie's details after watching--researching fun facts, the actors and actresses, and how it ranks amongst other people's tastes. One of the main places to get all that information and then some was IMDb. IMDb, or the Internet Movie Database, was first founded in 1990. Now owned by Amazon, it is arguably one of the most, if not the most, popular movie databases currently.
